# Representation Theory Notes

[Notes (in English)](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/RepTheoryEPFL/blob/main/TeX_Outputs/main.pdf) for MATH-314 (Representation Theory of Finite Groups) taught by Aluna Rizzoli at EPFL in 2024. They are a work in progress.

These notes are primarily based on the content covered in lectures, with some portions based on

* Lecture notes written in English by Travis Schedler for the course Group Representation Theory taught at Imperial College London in 2021.
* Lecture notes written in French by Donna Testerman for the course Représentations Linéaires des Groupes Finis taught at EPFL in 2022.
* Notes written by Sidharth Hariharan and Linxiao Cheng for a summer project undertaken at Imperial College London in 2023 under the supervision of Michele Zordan.

These notes were compiled by Sidharth Hariharan (who also owns this repository on GitHub). Sidharth took MATH-314 at EPFL whilst on a yearlong exchange programme from Imperial College London.
