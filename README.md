# Representation Theory Notes
[Notes (in English)](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/RepTheoryEPFL/blob/main/TeX_Outputs/main.pdf) for MATH-314 (Representation Theory of Finite Groups) taught by Aluna Rizzoli at EPFL in 2024. Work in progress, being written as the course progresses.

These notes are primarily based on notes written in English by Travis Schedler for the course Group Representation Theory taught at Imperial College London in 2021 and notes written in French by Donna Testerman for the course Représentations Linéaires des Groupes Finis taught at EPFL in 2022.
