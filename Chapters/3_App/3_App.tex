\chapter{Applications to the Study of Groups}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Thus far, we have explored the theory of representations, and characters thereof, as ends in themselves. In this chapter, we will explore the applications of the robust theory we have constructed so far in the study of groups. This will illustrate the utility of representation theory, and, more broadly, the power of understanding groups via their actions. Throughout this chapter, we will denote by $G$ an arbitrary finite group.
