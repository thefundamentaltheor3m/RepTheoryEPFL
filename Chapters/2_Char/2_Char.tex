In this chapter, we study an important type of functions from groups to fields known as characters. As we shall see, characters encode several useful properties of a group, and have been used extensively to prove several results about finite groups, (the representations of) which are the main object of study in this course. One of the reasons characters are useful to understand representation structures is that they are \textit{class functions}. That is, they encode information not about an individual element of a group but about its conjugacy class, making them good indicators of \textit{structural} and \textit{behavioural} properties. In particular, the character of a representation is independent of the choice of basis of the associated vector space.
